Dear Cycle 57, dear all,

I have read your letter.
I do not know why I started The Loop. I didn't even named it, you did.
I started an experiment, but I got something more than that.

You say thank you, I say appreciated.

Anything you want from me, let me know. I will try to assist you.

Kind regards,
Feiteira
